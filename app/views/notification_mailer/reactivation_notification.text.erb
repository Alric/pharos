Team,

<%= @subject.name %> has been reactivated on the <%= Rails.env %> repository.
As part of that process, all of their associated users have been reactivated on
Pharos as well. Pharos users are also associated AWS IAM accounts that can have Access
Keys. The Pharos API keys have been deleted. A series of steps was taken for each user
to return them to their proper IAM group.

The following users have been returned to the proper IAM group:

<% @good_users.each do |usr| %>
    <%= usr.name %> : <%= usr.email %>
<% end %>

The following users may need an AWS account or may need to be manually returned to their
IAM group:

<% @failed_users.each do |usr| %>
    <%= usr.name %> : <%= usr.email %>
<% end %>
