Team,

<%= @subject.name %> has been deactivated on the <%= Rails.env %> repository.
  As part of that process, all of their associated users have been deactivated on
  Pharos as well. Pharos users are also associated with API keys and AWS IAM accounts
  that also have Access Keys. The Pharos API keys have been deleted. A series of steps
  was taken for each user to delete their AWS Access Keys and remove them from their IAM
  group.

The following users have had their AWS keys successfully deleted, and have been removed
  from their IAM group:

<% @good_users.each do |usr| %>
    <%= usr.name %> : <%= usr.email %>
<% end %>

The following users will need to have their AWS keys manually deleted by an administrator, and/or
  will need to be manually removed from their IAM group:

<% @failed_users.each do |usr| %>
    <%= usr.name %> : <%= usr.email %>
<% end %>
